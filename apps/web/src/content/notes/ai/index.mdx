### OneTwentyOne

**Location:** Ithaca // San Francisco, 2023-present

**Role:** Founder, CEO

**Description:**
I started OneTwentyOne in 2023 after I got my first blood test, and noticed an abnormality my PCP didn't (high serum folate, high serum B12, high homocysteine → functional B12 deficiency from C677T homozygous mutation).

We tried our hand at a mobile app first, but our real technical IP was in our data analysis and sync engine. In summer 2024, we partnered with Michael Lustgarten, Ph.D, to build **Conquer** (https://conquer.onetwentyone.ai), a biomarker analysis tool. Try it now!
